## Structure Overview
<img width="618" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-26 at 7 09 59 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77218372/143564097-cbd81dca-9bfa-4bd2-80f9-b4e02e4ffa6c.png">

There are total 5 classes in this ATMController : Controller, Bank, Card, Account and CashBin. Card and Account objects are stored inside the bank and the controller only holds the card number and account number that it's dealing at each operation. Each time the controller needs more information about the card or account (username, balance, etc.), it needs to send request to the bank module. To check whether the pin number (for card) or password (for account) is correct, it needs to send a request to the bank module and get the answer not in the 'pin' or 'password' format, but only in 'True' or 'False' format.

## Features

### Start

The ATM starts with following.
```

### Option 1 : Insert Card / Enter Account Number
The user should then choose one of these 2 actions to proceed.

**1) Insert a Card**

After inserting a card (typing the card number), the user needs to type in the correct PIN number to proceed. If not, the ATM will terminate.
